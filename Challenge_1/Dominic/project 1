What is forking a repository?

Forking a repository can be explained as making your own personal copy of a repository that is part of a different organization or person’s account.
There is no GitHub Command for forking a repository, it can simply be done by clicking repo, followed by fork.

2. Cloning a repository...

This is the process of downloading a repo offline and being able to edit it  
The Git Command line is as follows.

Open “Git Bash” and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
Type git clone in the terminal, paste the URL you copied earlier, and press “enter” to create your local clone.
